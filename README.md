## General Info
These are the results from working through some basic coding challenges from sites like freecodecamp and geeksforgeeks.
## Technologies Used
Written entirely in vanilla JavaScript, but setup for the module system in node.js.
## Features
* Conversion between fahrenheit and celsius, either way.
* Calculate the nth value of the factorials, by looping and, also, using recursion.
* Find the longest word in a sentence.
* Reverse a String.
* Titlecase a String.
* Spinalcase a String.
* Find the list of primes below some number, n. (using the sieve of Eratosthenes).
* Sum the first n primes.
## Setup
Just download the code file, and require the necessary code into your project. Or rewrite to use as an import, for example, for React.
## Usage
Just require the code, then call the function or object into your project to use it. For example, if the file, facInt.js is in the same directory as the file which uses that code: 
```
const facInt = require('./facInt');
...
const fifthFactorial = facInt(5);
```
The above will allow you to store the value of the expression 5! to the variable fifthFactorial.
## Acknowledgements
These challenges are from lists of challenges from websites such as freecodecamp and geeksforgeeks.
